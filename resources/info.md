## **How to use the app**

In the **"Recommender System"** tab, the user can select 3 of their favourite movies from the available list of movies, and the app will recommend 10 movies for the user to watch. The user should choose the content-based filtering option for this to work. 

In the **"Content vs Collaborative"** tab, the user can gain an understanding of content-based filtering and collaborative-based filtering.

In the **"Data Insights"** tab, one can have a look at:

1. The distribution of genres
2. The distribution of the decades of the release of movies
3. The distribution of the ratings
4. The highest-rated movies 
5. The lowest-rated movies 

(Note that these were calculated using the [Bayesian average](https://www.evanmiller.org/bayesian-average-ratings.html), which takes into account the number of ratings).


## **The data**

This dataset consists of several million ratings obtained from users of the online MovieLens movie recommendation service. The MovieLens dataset has long been used by industry and academic researchers to improve the performance of explicitly-based recommender systems.

The data for the MovieLens dataset is maintained by the GroupLens research group in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Minnesota. Additional movie content data was legally scraped from IMDB.
